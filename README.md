# CarPanel
## About
A recreation of my cars (Å koda Fabia) instrument cluster.
## Plans
- [ ] Create a working GUI with local based controls using the built in ```Control``` class.
- [ ] Link it to hardware, possibly using CAN bus or an MCU through serial.
- [ ] Try and create implementations into games (e.g. ETS2 and other driving games allowing modding)
## To-do
- [ ] Fully implement ```Control``` with ```CarPanel``` to allow full control of the GUI.
- [ ] Generate bitmaps of ISO symbols for the cluster.
- [ ] Create a hardware hook (unknown if CAN or serial).
- [ ] Create hardware to sync with the GUI.
- [ ] Create hooks for games.
